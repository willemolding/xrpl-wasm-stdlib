//! # Transaction Field Access Traits
//!
//! This module defines traits for accessing fields from XRPL transactions in a type-safe manner.
//! It provides a structured interface for retrieving both common transaction fields (shared across
//! all transaction types) and transaction-specific fields (unique to particular transaction types).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! XRPL transactions contain a variety of fields, some mandatory and others optional. This module
//! organizes field access into logical groups:
//!
//! - **Common Fields**: Fields present in all XRPL transactions (Account, Fee, Sequence, etc.)
//! - **Transaction-Specific Fields**: Fields unique to specific transaction types
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! The trait-based design provides several benefits:
//!
//! - **Type Safety**: Each field is accessed through methods with appropriate return types
//! - **Composability**: Transaction types can implement multiple traits as needed
//! - **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: Trait methods compile down to direct host function calls
//! - **Extensibility**: New transaction types can easily implement the relevant traits
//!
//! ## Field Categories
//!
//! ### Mandatory vs. Optional Fields
//!
//! - **Mandatory fields** return `Result<T>` and will error if missing
//! - **Optional fields** return `Result<Option<T>>` and return `None` if missing
//!
//! ### Field Types
//!
//! - **AccountID**: 20-byte account identifiers
//! - **Hash256**: 256-bit cryptographic hashes
//! - **Amount**: XRP amounts (with future support for tokens)
//! - **u32**: 32-bit unsigned integers for sequence numbers, flags, etc.
//! - **Blob**: Variable-length binary data
//! - **PublicKey**: 33-byte compressed public keys
//! - **TransactionType**: Enumerated transaction type identifiers
